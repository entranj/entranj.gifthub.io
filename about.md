# About Me
Hello! I am SC.
For my age, I have a lot of skills and hobbies. I enjoy all forms of sports and art, specifically football, volleyball and swimming. I spend a lot of my time drawing or sewing. I plan to pursue a career in fashion, so I use my free time to make pieces to add to my portfolio. Most people go into much more "stable" careers and I understand. If being a fashion designer doesn't work out i'd take a chance at being a lawyer. Regardless though, I chose this career because fashion is more to me than just clothing and old catalogs. Its self expression, life and representation. If you can't dress how you want, what's the point? 
I want to make clothes that are comfortable, appealing and affordable. Some skills such as collaboration and continuing to learn the basics to coding will help me succeed. I feel this way because I can better learn to work with people and how to make a website for myself or company.
